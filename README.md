By achieving these objectives, the challenge aims to not only advance participants' technical and analytical skills but also contribute to sustainable agricultural practices through the application of AI.

## 2. Data Source

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The dataset for the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Challenge is a comprehensive collection of annotated images representing various common diseases affecting cassava plants, one of the most crucial crop resources in tropical and subtropical regions. It includes thousands of high-resolution images categorized into several disease classes, as well as a category for healthy leaves. This dataset provides a rich resource for developing and testing machine learning models aimed at identifying and classifying plant diseases based on visual evidence.

### 2.2 Accessing the Dataset

The dataset is hosted on Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and collaborative projects. Participants can access the dataset by following these steps:

1. **Create or Sign into Kaggle:** Navigate to [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com) and either sign in to your existing account or create a new one.
2. **Navigate to the Dataset:** Use the search feature on Kaggle to find the "Cassava Leaf Disease Classification" dataset or access it directly through this link: [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/cassava-leaf-disease-classification).
3. **Download the Dataset:** Once on the dataset page, look for the "Download" button (usually located at the top right of the page) to download the dataset files to your local machine.

Participants are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the dataset upon download, noting the structure, format, and the different classes of diseases included. This preliminary step is crucial for effective data exploration and preprocessing, setting the stage for successful model development.
